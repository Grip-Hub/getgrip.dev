            **No Python required. Download, double-click, search.**

            | Platform | Download |
            |----------|----------|
            | Windows | GRIP-Windows.exe |
            | macOS | GRIP-macOS |
            | Linux | GRIP-Linux |

            Your browser opens automatically to the GRIP search interface.
            Keep the console window open while using GRIP.

            **macOS users:** If you see "unidentified developer", right-click → Open → Open Anyway.
            Or run: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./GRIP-macOS`

            **Still prefer pip?** `pip install getgrip`

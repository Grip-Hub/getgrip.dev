  2. DEFINITIONS

  "Licensor" means Michael Davis, an individual, sole owner
  and developer of the GRIP software.

  "Licensee" means the individual or entity that has obtained
  a copy of GRIP under the terms of this Agreement.

  "GRIP" or "Software" means the GRIP retrieval engine,
  including all source code, compiled binaries, documentation,
  configuration files, plugins, CLI tools, API endpoints, and
  any updates or patches provided by Licensor.

  "Deployment" means a single running instance of the GRIP
  engine, whether on a physical server, virtual machine,
  container, or container orchestration cluster (e.g.,
  Kubernetes). Each Deployment requires its own license key.
  A Deployment includes all replicas, pods, or processes
  serving requests from a single logical GRIP installation.

  "Chunk" means a discrete unit of indexed content within a
  GRIP Deployment, as counted by the engine's internal
  indexing system.

  "Production Use" means any use that serves end users,
  customers, or downstream systems in a live, staging, or
  pre-production environment, or that processes data for
  business operations.

  "Organization" means the legal entity (corporation, LLC,
  partnership, sole proprietorship, non-profit, or government
  agency) identified in the license purchase, including its
  wholly-owned subsidiaries.

  "Compiled Binaries" means any .so, .pyd, .dll, or other
  machine-code files distributed as part of GRIP.

  "Accelerated Engine" means the optional GPU-accelerated
  retrieval engine available under a separate NDA as described
  in Section 6.

  "Confidential Information" means all technical details,
  documentation, benchmarks, source code, and implementation
  specifics of the Accelerated Engine disclosed to Licensee,
  as further defined in the mutual NDA.

  3. LICENSE GRANT

  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensor grants
  Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
  non-sublicensable, revocable license to use GRIP solely
  within the tier obtained and in accordance with the
  restrictions below. No rights are granted except those
  expressly stated. All rights not granted are reserved.

  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  3.1 GRIP FREE

  GRIP Free is a demonstration version of the GRIP retrieval
  engine provided at no cost for evaluation, personal,
  educational, and internal non-production use only.

  10. AUDIT RIGHTS

  During the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year
  following termination, Licensor shall have the right, upon
  thirty (30) days' prior written notice and no more than once
  per twelve-month period, to audit Licensee's use of GRIP to
  verify compliance with this Agreement, including but not
  limited to Chunk counts, Deployment counts, and usage within
  the licensed tier.

  Audits shall be conducted during Licensee's normal business
  hours in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee's
  operations. Licensor may designate a qualified independent
  third party to conduct the audit, provided such third party
  executes a confidentiality agreement with Licensee prior to
  the audit.

  If the audit reveals material non-compliance (defined as
  exceeding licensed Chunk or Deployment limits by ten percent
  (10%) or more, or any unauthorized Production Use of GRIP
  Free), Licensee shall: (a) promptly cure the non-compliance
  by purchasing the appropriate license tier; and (b) reimburse
  Licensor for the reasonable costs of the audit.

  Licensor shall not require direct access to Licensee's
  systems. Audits may be conducted through self-reporting by
  Licensee, review of GRIP's internal usage metrics, or
  inspection of deployment records provided by Licensee.

  all right, title, and interest in and to such Feedback.
  Licensor may use, incorporate, and commercialize Feedback for
  any purpose without restriction, attribution, or compensation
  to Licensee. Licensee represents that any Feedback provided
  does not violate the intellectual property rights of any
  third party.
